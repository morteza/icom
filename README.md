ICOM analysis and codes


## Dependencies

First, create a conda environment with all the required dependencies:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

It creates a new environment called `icom` with all dependencies installed. Finally, you only need to activate the *icom* conda environment:

```bash
conda activate icom
```
